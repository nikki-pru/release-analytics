# Liferay Release Analytics

Release analytics for Liferay DXP. The platform serves three distinct use cases:

- **Dashboard pipeline:** Export analysis-ready CSVs that power Looker Studio dashboards for release planning and post-release review.
- **Branch risk scoring:** Evaluate a pull request against a local portal checkout and return a composite risk score before merge.
- **Ad hoc analysis:** Query the PostgreSQL database directly, or run standalone R scripts, for deeper investigation — complexity trends, LDA topic modeling, fix management conflict analysis, Testray new test failures.

---

## Overview

```
Jira (LPP/LPD)   ──┐
Testray          ──┤
lizard (CCN)     ──┤──► PostgreSQL ──► export_looker.R ──► Google Sheets ──► Looker Studio
git churn        ──┘                       │
                                           └──► lda_analysis.R ──► topic PNGs + CSVs

liferay-portal checkout ──► evaluate_pr.sh ──► branch risk score (standalone)
```

**Stack:** R (analytics core), PostgreSQL 14+, Looker Studio, Google Sheets, lizard CLI

**Why R:** LDA topic modeling, count regression, text mining map naturally to R's statistical ecosystem (`topicmodels`, `MASS`, `tidytext`). Outputs are CSVs — the language is invisible to end users.

**Pending move to Python for accessibility to a wider pool of Engineers**

## Dashboards

### Release Situation Deck
**Question:** *Where should we focus testing for this release?*

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| Bug Forecast | Predicted internal defects (LPD) per component. Random Forest model, R²=0.56, validated on most recent mature quarter. LPP shown as historical risk ranking — forecasting not viable at current data volume. |
| Team Release Story | Single-page team one-pager. Signal → Story → Stakes structure: Headline Bar, Where You Stand, Risk Heat Map (S01), Stakes/Forecast (`lpp_hist_score` vs `lpd_pred` with actuals). Switchable by team. |
| Risk Heat Map | Heatmap of risk indicators per component: historical customer bug exposure, historical internal defects, backend churn, frontend churn, Java insertions, TSX insertions. |
| Churn Trends | Code churn by quarter and team — backend vs frontend split. Covers all U and Q releases. |
| Team Scorecard | Per-team: LPP count, LPD count, release blocker count, acceptance test catch rate, release test catch rate. Quadrant analysis: high LPD + low LPP = catching bugs before customers; high LPP + high pass rate = testing the wrong things. |
| Model Notes | LPD model R², MAE, validation quarter, calibration factor. LPP data maturity note. |

### Release Landscape Report
**Question:** *What did we miss and what should we do next?*

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| Severity Distribution | LPP vs LPD severity breakdown by quarter. Are we catching high-priority bugs internally before they reach customers? |
| Bug Discovery Timing | How many days before/after customer reports did internal testing find the same issue? Positive = customer found first (bad). |
| Language Blind Spots | Terms appearing disproportionately in customer bugs vs internal bugs — signals where internal testing coverage may be misaligned. |
| Complexity & Tech Debt | lizard-derived CCN and NLOC by component and team, split by Java vs frontend. Note: Commerce sub-components share a codebase — metrics are distributed equally across them. |
| Topic Analysis | LDA topic modeling on bug summaries. Which themes dominate customer bugs vs internal bugs? Three periods: all time, 2024 (pre-process change), 2025 (post-process change). Filter by `period` field (not `year`). |

## Branch Risk Scoring Engine

A standalone scoring engine that evaluates risk for a specific pull request against a local `liferay-portal` checkout. Independent of the dashboard pipeline — runs locally against a developer's branch.

### What it scores

Five signals with composite weights:

| Signal | Weight | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Code complexity | 28% | lizard CCN (cyclomatic), NLOC as cognitive proxy |
| Churn | 25% | Git diff |
| Defects | 20% | Jira LPD history |
| Test coverage | 15% | Testray |
| Dependencies | 12% | OSGi module graph — blast radius (incoming) + integration depth (outgoing), blended 60/40 |

### Running it

```bash
cd /path/to/liferay-portal
bash /path/to/liferay-release-analytics/apps/scoring/evaluate_pr.sh --branch your-branch-name
```

---

## Ad Hoc Analysis

The PostgreSQL database is the primary artifact — the pipeline populates it; the dashboards read from it; but it can also be queried directly for investigations that don't fit the dashboard format.

### Fix Management conflict analysis

`FixManagementAnalysis.R` (and the accompanying `FixManagementDashboard.Rmd` Flexdashboard) covers LPP Fix Management conflict tickets with paginated Jira extraction, LDA topic modeling, TF-IDF component signatures, LPD co-occurrence, and version normalization. Run independently of the main pipeline. A Docker deployment is available for the Flexdashboard.

```r
source("reports/fix_management/FixManagementAnalysis.R")
```

### Complexity deep dives

`fact_file_complexity` holds lizard CCN and NLOC at file level with Java/frontend splits. Join to `dim_component` via `dim_module_component_map` for component-level queries. Useful for identifying files where `max_ccn` exceeds the p95 threshold (16) and correlating against elevated LPD counts — particularly in high-churn components like Objects and Web Content.

Key fields: `avg_ccn`, `max_ccn`, `avg_nloc`, `avg_ccn_java`, `avg_ccn_frontend`, `language_mix`.

### LDA topic modeling (standalone)

Topic analysis runs separately from the main pipeline (~5 minutes). Outputs topic PNGs and CSVs to `reports/release_landscape/exports/`.

```r
source("reports/release_landscape/lda_analysis.R")
```

Outputs land in `topics_2024/`, `topics_2025/`, and `topics_all_time/` under the exports directory.

### Testray: new test failures against a git diff

The `fact_test_quality` table links Testray test cases to bug outcomes and catch rates. Two routine signals are tracked:

| Signal | Routine ID | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Acceptance | 590307 | Daily |
| Release | 82964 | Pre-ship |

These can be queried to surface test cases that are newly failing — i.e., cases with recent first-failure dates not previously associated with a known bug — which is useful for triaging whether a new failure represents a real regression or test environment noise.

**Triage pipeline (in progress):** A lightweight pipeline cross-references new failures against a git diff to classify likely causes before handing off to AI for reasoning. No MCP infrastructure required — the temporary workflow is:

  Query the database comparing two build pairs
  
  -> new failures are returned 
  
  -> Extract git changed files and classes from the branch are reviewed 
  
  -> cross-reference failing test class names against the changed file list and classify each failure
  
  -> Paste the classified output and diff for reasoning: distinguish likely regressions from environment noise, suggest which failures warrant a bug, and identify patterns across the failure set.

Longer term, classified failure results feed into `pr_outcomes` in Release Analytics Platform providing labeled training data for the NN-based PR risk prediction layer.

## Data Sources

| Source | What We Pull | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Jira LPP** | Customer-reported bugs (`project = LPP`) from 2024.Q1 onwards. Assigned to quarters via `affectedVersion`. | Jira REST API v3 `/search/jql` |
| **Jira LPD** | Internal bugs (`project = LPD`) from 2023-11-05 onwards. Assigned to quarters via `created_date` → dev window lookup. Release blockers flagged via `labels = "release-blocker"`. | Jira REST API v3 `/search/jql` |
| **Testray** | Test case pass/fail history, bug linkage, catch rates. 150GB backup loaded into local `testray_analysis` PostgreSQL DB. | PostgreSQL → `extract_testray.R` |
| **lizard** | Cyclomatic complexity (CCN) and NLOC by function, aggregated to file level. Java and frontend (JS/TS/JSX/TSX) scored separately. Excludes third-party, ANTLR-generated, and OSB modules. CCN capped at 100. | `lizard` CLI → `data/lizard_output_YYYYMMDD.csv` → `utils/load_lizard.R` |
| **Git churn** | Java, TypeScript, JSX, SCSS insertions/deletions per module per quarter and U release. | Pre-computed CSVs in `data/` → `utils/ingest_churn_csv.R` |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- R 4.x with the following packages: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `DBI`, `RPostgres`, `yaml`, `httr`, `jsonlite`, `logger`, `glue`, `MASS`, `randomForest`, `tidytext`, `topicmodels`, `ggplot2`, `flexdashboard`, `DT`, `crosstalk`, `htmltools`
- PostgreSQL 14+
- lizard: `pipx install lizard` (only needed to regenerate complexity from a fresh portal checkout — not required to run the dashboard pipeline against an existing snapshot)
- Access to Jira and Testray (or a copy of the database — see below)

### Database

The platform uses a PostgreSQL database (`release_analytics`). To set up from scratch:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE release_analytics;"
psql -U postgres -d release_analytics -f db/schema.sql
psql -U postgres -d release_analytics -f db/migrations/migration_1.3.sql
psql -U postgres -d release_analytics -f db/migrations/migration_1.4.sql
psql -U postgres -d release_analytics -f db/migrations/migration_1.5.sql
psql -U postgres -d release_analytics -f db/migrations/migration_1.6.sql
```

**Don't want to run the full pipeline?** You can request a database snapshot from [@nikki-pru]. This gives you a pre-populated database you can query directly, run ad hoc analysis against, or use to render dashboards without re-running all extracts.

### Database snapshot (recommended for contributors)

**Request:** Reach out to @nikki-pru to get the latest `release_analytics_YYYYMMDD.dump` file.

**Restore:**

```bash
# 1. Create the database
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE release_analytics;"

# 2. Restore from snapshot (custom format)
pg_restore -U postgres -d release_analytics -F c release_analytics_YYYYMMDD.dump

# 3. Verify
psql -U postgres -d release_analytics -c "\dt"
```

If you get a `role does not exist` error during restore:
```bash
pg_restore -U postgres -d release_analytics -F c --no-owner --no-privileges release_analytics_YYYYMMDD.dump
```

**What's included in the snapshot:**
- `dim_release` — 44 releases (U110–U148, 2024.Q1–2026.Q1)
- `dim_component` — 240 components across 15 teams
- `dim_module_component_map` — 779 module → component mappings
- `fact_forecast_input` — churn + bug counts per component × quarter
- `fact_file_complexity` — lizard complexity metrics per file (`avg_ccn`, `max_ccn`, `avg_nloc`, Java/frontend split)
- `fact_test_quality` — Testray bug catch rates per test case
- `dim_file` — 58,881 file registry entries
- `dim_module` — with `module_path_full` and `module_path_category` join keys
- `scoring_normalization` — p95 denominators for signal normalization; documents calibration decisions

**What's NOT included:**
- Raw Testray case results (150GB source — available separately on request)
- Your local credentials (`config/config.yml`)
- `lizard_output_YYYYMMDD.csv` (regenerate with `lizard` CLI — see below)

### Regenerating lizard complexity

lizard complexity data is not included in the snapshot (CSV is large). To regenerate:

```bash
# Install lizard
pipx install lizard

# Run from liferay-portal root
lizard ./modules \
  --languages java javascript typescript \
  --CCN 1 --length 1 \
  --output_file lizard_output_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv \
  -x '*/node_modules/*' -x '*/build/*' -x '*/dist/*' \
  -x '*/.gradle/*' -x '*/gradleTest/*' \
  -x '*/test/*' -x '*/testIntegration/*'

# Copy CSV to liferay-release-analytics/data/
# Then load:
Rscript utils/load_lizard.R
```

### Config

```bash
cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
```

Fill in your credentials:

```yaml
databases:
  release_analytics:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    dbname: release_analytics
    user: your_user
    password: your_password

jira:
  base_url: https://liferay.atlassian.net
  email: your_email@liferay.com
  api_token: your_token
  fix_priority_field: customfield_10211
  queries:
    lpp: "project = LPP and ..."
    lpd: "project = LPD AND ..."
    lpd_blockers: "project in (LPD,LPS) AND labels = \"release-blocker\" AND ..."
  dev_windows:
    - quarter: "2024.Q1"
      dev_start: "2023-11-05"
      dev_end: "2024-02-07"
    # ... add quarters as needed
```

---

## Running the Pipeline

Run all scripts from the **project root** (`~/dev/projects/liferay-release-analytics`).

### Full pipeline

```bash
bash run_pipeline.sh
```

Options:
- `--skip-jira` — use cached Jira data
- `--skip-lizard` — skip complexity reload (use existing `fact_file_complexity`)
- `--skip-export` — skip Looker CSV export
- `--run-lda` — include LDA topic analysis (~5 min)
- `--step STEP` — run a single step only
- `--dry-run` — preview steps without executing

Steps in order: `sync_releases` → `load_map` → `load_lizard` → `ingest_churn` → `extract_jira` → `transform` → `export` → `lda`

Or run steps individually in R from the project root:

```r
source("utils/sync_releases.R")
source("utils/load_module_component_map.R")
Rscript utils/load_lizard.R          # complexity — run as script
source("utils/ingest_churn_csv.R")
source("extract/extract_jira.R")
source("transform/transform_forecast_input.R")
source("utils/export_looker.R")
```

### Topic analysis (run separately, ~5 minutes)

```r
source("reports/release_landscape/lda_analysis.R")
```

Outputs land in `reports/release_landscape/exports/topics_2024/`, `topics_2025/`, and `topics_all_time/`.

### Local R dashboard (without Looker)

```r
rmarkdown::render(
  "reports/situation_deck/release_situation_deck.Rmd",
  params = list(forecast_label = "2026.Q1", top_n = 20, exclude_2024 = FALSE)
)
```

Change `forecast_label` to any release in `dim_release` (e.g. `"U147"`, `"2025.Q4"`).

### Looker Studio dashboards

## Key Design Decisions

### Complexity Signal

**Why `max_ccn` instead of `avg_ccn_java`?** A single worst-case function better captures the tail risk that produces defects than a file-level average that smooths over it. The p95 denominator is fixed at 16 — lizard's warning threshold — with CCN capped at 100 before aggregation. These calibration decisions are recorded in `scoring_normalization` to prevent silent recalibration.

**Why lizard instead of SonarQube?** SonarQube's strength is the full quality gate — violations, coverage, security — none of which are needed for release risk scoring. lizard runs locally, outputs directly to CSV, and is significantly faster on the liferay-portal codebase. CCN from lizard is a direct equivalent to SonarQube's cyclomatic complexity; NLOC serves as a cognitive load proxy. `tech_debt_minutes` is dashboard-display only and is not part of the scoring model.

### Bug Forecasting

**Why historical ranking instead of LPP forecasting?** 62% of component×quarter rows have zero LPP bugs. With only 5 mature training quarters available, count models produce unreliable predictions. LPP is shown as a percentile ranking based on historical exposure + current churn.

**Why a maturity filter on LPD training?** Quarters with fewer than 9 months in field have incomplete bug counts. Only quarters with `months_in_field >= 9` are used for model training.

### LDA / Topic Modeling

**Why separate 2024 and 2025 LDA runs?** A process change in early 2024 makes the two years' bug populations not directly comparable. The 2024 vs 2025 topic divergence is itself a finding worth surfacing.
