# apps/triage

Triage app for the Liferay Release Analytics Platform.

Answers the question: **"Which test failures in Build B are real bugs
introduced since Build A?"**

Part of the three-app structure:

- `apps/scoring/`   — "How risky is this component?"
- `apps/triage/`    — "Which failures are real bugs?" ← this app
- `apps/dashboard/` — "How do we surface it?"

**Status: PoC.** First successful end-to-end run completed April 2026
against Routine 82964 (Release signal).

## Two classification modes

`prepare.py` produces a classifier-agnostic run bundle. Choose who
reads it:

| Mode | When | Entry point | Extra install |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (default) | Local dev — a developer classifies in their own Claude Code session | Open `runs/r_<id>/prompt.md` in-session, write `results.json` by hand | none |
| **API** | Jenkins / headless / no Claude Code available | `python3 -m apps.triage.classify_api <run_dir>` | `pip install -r apps/triage/requirements-api.txt` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var |

Both modes consume the same bundle and produce the same `results.json`.
The only thing that changes is the `classifier` label persisted to
`fact_triage_results` — `agent:claude-opus-4-7` vs `api:claude-opus-4-7`
— so the two paths are directly comparable for the same build pair.

---

## How it works

```
┌─ Claude Code mode (local) ──────────────────┐  ┌─ API mode (Jenkins / headless) ──────┐
│ prepare.py                                  │  │ run_triage_api.sh                    │
│   ↓                                         │  │   (internally: prepare → classify    │
│ runs/r_<id>/ (prompt.md, diff_list.csv,     │  │    via Anthropic API → submit)       │
│              hunks.txt, schema, run.yml)    │  │                                      │
│   ↓                                         │  │                                      │
│ [Claude Code session reads prompt.md,       │  │                                      │
│  writes results.json]                       │  │                                      │
│   ↓                                         │  │                                      │
│ submit.py → fact_triage_results             │  │ fact_triage_results                  │
│   classifier: agent:claude-opus-4-7         │  │   classifier: api:claude-opus-4-7    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Both modes consume the same bundle shape and produce the same
`results.json`. The `classifier` label in `fact_triage_results`
distinguishes them so runs on the same build pair are directly
comparable — see `compare_classifiers.py`.

Inside `prepare.py`:

```
test_diff.sql              → PASSED→FAILED/BLOCKED/UNTESTED from testray_analytical
        ↓
dim_build lookup           → git_hash + routine_id per build
        ↓
git diff (liferay-portal)  → full unified diff, releng/XML/json/etc excluded
        ↓
extract_relevant_hunks.py  → filtered diff — only hunks matching failing test modules
        ↓
prompt_helpers.pre_classify→ env/infra errors flagged as pre_classification
        ↓
prompt_helpers.find_diff_blocks + prompt body assembly → prompt.md per failure
```

`submit.py` validates `results.json`, merges classifier output with
auto-classified + flaky rows, and upserts under the classifier label from
`run.yml` / `results.json`.

## Setup

### 1. Virtual environment

```bash
cd ~/dev/projects/liferay-release-analytics
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r apps/triage/requirements.txt

# API mode only — skip if you only classify via Claude Code
pip install -r apps/triage/requirements-api.txt
```

Always activate before running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Config — add to `config/config.yml`

```yaml
git:
  repo_path: ~/dev/projects/liferay-portal
  base_branch: master

databases:
  release_analytics:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    dbname: release_analytics
    user: release
    password: ...
  testray:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    dbname: testray_analytical
    user: release
    password: ...

# Optional — pattern extensions for prepare.py pre-classification
triage:
  auto_classify_patterns:
    ENV_DEPENDENCY:
      - "your-extra-pattern-here"
```

Claude Code mode needs no API key. For API mode, set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment (**never** put it in
`config.yml`). API-mode tunables live under `triage.classifier.api.*`
— see `config/config.yml.example`.

### 3. Testray DB permissions (if your local DB was bootstrapped fresh)

```bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d testray_analytical -c \
  "GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO release;"
```

### 4. Release Analytics migrations applied

`fact_triage_results` must be at schema version ≥ 1.9 (adds the
`classifier` column). Applied automatically if you run all migrations in
`db/migrations/` against a fresh `release_analytics` DB.

---

## Usage

Each side (baseline, target) independently selects a source: `db`
(`testray_analytical`), `csv` (Testray CSV export), or `api` (Testray
REST, OAuth2 client_credentials).

```bash
python3 -m apps.triage.prepare \
    --baseline-source {db,csv,api} --baseline-build-id <A> \
        [--baseline-csv  <path>]  [--baseline-hash <sha>] [--baseline-name <str>] \
    --target-source   {db,csv,api} --target-build-id   <B> \
        [--target-csv    <path>]  [--target-hash   <sha>] [--target-name   <str>]
```

**Per-source arg rules:**

| Source | Extra args | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | none | Build metadata from `dim_build`. Fails if the build isn't in the local DB. |
| `csv` | `--{side}-csv`, `--{side}-hash` | Exports carry `(Case Name, Component)` but no `case_id` or git sha — you must pass `--{side}-hash` manually. `--{side}-name` is optional. |
| `api` | nothing required | `--{side}-hash` is optional (falls back to `dim_build`; required if the build isn't in the local DB). Requires `testray.client_id`/`testray.client_secret` in `config.yml`. |

### Examples

```bash
# Both builds in testray_analytical (the historical PoC case).
python3 -m apps.triage.prepare \
    --baseline-source db --baseline-build-id 451312408 \
    --target-source   db --target-build-id   462975400

# DB baseline; target from a Testray CSV export (target too new for the dump).
python3 -m apps.triage.prepare \
    --baseline-source db  --baseline-build-id 451312408 \
    --target-source   csv --target-build-id   462975400 \
        --target-csv ~/Downloads/case_results.csv \
        --target-hash 77445e4a3a4725acd868027493b96ef41d6afbe8

# DB baseline; target fetched live from Testray REST.
python3 -m apps.triage.prepare \
    --baseline-source db  --baseline-build-id 451312408 \
    --target-source   api --target-build-id   462975400

# Fully detached — no local DB required. Both sides from Testray REST.
python3 -m apps.triage.prepare \
    --baseline-source api --baseline-build-id 451312408 --baseline-hash <sha> \
    --target-source   api --target-build-id   462975400 --target-hash   <sha>
```

**CSV matching:** CSV exports have no `case_id`, so matching to the
other side happens on `(Case Name, Component)`. The side with a
`case_id` contributes it on join; rows that don't match anywhere are
dropped (they can't be persisted to `fact_triage_results`).

**`api` Jira gap.** API responses don't carry `linked_issues` directly —
the `jira:` line is absent from per-failure sections in `prompt.md` when
the target is `api`. Classification still works; use `db` or `csv` on
the target if Jira ticket context matters. `prepare.py` prints this
warning at runtime.

**`csv × api` is not supported today.** CSV has names, no id; API has id,
no names — no common join key. `prepare.py` hard-errors with a PoC note.
Workarounds: use `db` on at least one side, or use the same source on
both sides (`api × api`, `csv × csv`).

Expected API fetch time: ~1.5 minutes per side for ~15k case results (30
pages × 500, 0.3s between).

### Classify + submit (same for all source combos)

**Option A — Claude Code (default, local dev):**

```bash
# 2. Classify inside your own Claude Code session:
#    open runs/r_<id>/prompt.md, write runs/r_<id>/results.json

# 3. Submit
python3 -m apps.triage.submit apps/triage/runs/r_<id>
```

**Option B — API (Jenkins / headless):**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# One-shot: prepare + classify via API + submit. No Claude Code in the loop.
./apps/triage/run_triage_api.sh --build-a <A> --build-b <B>

# Add --dry-run to see the batch plan with no API call / no submit.
# Add --no-upsert to validate results.json without writing to DB.
# Add --classifier <label> to override the default api:claude-opus-4-7.
# Orthogonal --baseline-source / --target-source flags pass through to prepare.py
# for csv or api sources — see ./apps/triage/run_triage_api.sh --help.
```

**Either mode** — validate + print summary without writing to DB:

```bash
python3 -m apps.triage.submit apps/triage/runs/r_<id> --no-upsert
```

`prepare.py` takes `--classifier <label>` to override the default
(`agent:claude-opus-4-7`). The label is written to `run.yml` and then
into `fact_triage_results.classifier`. API mode defaults to
`api:claude-opus-4-7` regardless of what `prepare.py` wrote — use
`--classifier` on `classify_api.py` to override.

**API batching and cost.** `classify_api.py` packs the failures in
`prompt.md` into batches under `max_chars_per_batch` (default 400k
chars ≈ 100k input tokens) and sends each as one API call. The shared
header (context + rubric + output spec) is sent with Anthropic's
`cache_control: ephemeral` on every batch, so only the first batch
pays full price for it — subsequent batches read it at ~10% cost
within the 5-minute cache window. A 320-failure bundle fits in ~4
batches and is the primary reason batching matters; smaller bundles
land in one call. Shrink `max_chars_per_batch` only if very large
bundles hit output-token truncation. Cost per classification is
dominated by input tokens, not call count.

## Docker (GHCR)

The same package ships as a standalone image, `ghcr.io/liferay-release/triage`,
for headless / no-checkout-of-this-repo use. It is built straight from
this directory — the code is layout-agnostic (relative imports +
`$TRIAGE_CONFIG`), so there is no separate "standalone copy" to maintain;
the image *is* the artifact.

Default distribution mode is **api×api** (Testray REST on both sides), so
no database is required. The one runtime dependency is a liferay-portal
checkout for the git diff — mounted as a volume.

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  -v "$PWD/config.yml":/config/config.yml:ro \
  -v /path/to/liferay-portal:/portal \
  ghcr.io/liferay-release/triage run \
    --baseline-source api --baseline-build-id <A> --baseline-hash <sha> \
    --target-source   api --target-build-id   <B> --target-hash   <sha> \
    --no-upsert
```

Commands: `prepare`, `classify`, `submit`, `run` (one-shot api pipeline),
`help`. See `config.yml.example` for the mounted config shape; the image
resolves it via `$TRIAGE_CONFIG` (default `/config/config.yml`).

Published by `.github/workflows/triage-image.yml` — push a `triage-v*`
tag for a versioned image + `:latest`, or run the workflow manually with
a custom tag. Files: `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `entrypoint.sh`,
`config.yml.example`.

## Output

In `apps/triage/runs/r_<id>/` (gitignored):

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `run.yml` | Build IDs + hashes + routine + classifier + counts |
| `diff_list.csv` | One row per non-duplicate case with component/team + `pre_classification` |
| `git_diff_full.diff` | Unfiltered git diff between the two hashes |
| `hunks.txt` | Diff filtered to hunks matching failing test modules |
| `test_fragments.txt` | Fragments fed into `extract_relevant_hunks.py` |
| `prompt.md` | Instructions for the classification session |
| `results.schema.json` | JSON schema for `results.json` |
| `results.json` | **Written by the Claude Code session, or by `classify_api.py`** |

Persisted in `release_analytics`:

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `fact_triage_results` | One row per `(build_id_b, testray_case_id, classifier)` — upserted on re-run |
| `triage_run_log` | One row per `submit.py` invocation — classification totals, duration, notes |

---

## Classifications

| Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BUG`             | Error plausibly caused by a specific change in the diff. MUST name a `culprit_file`. |
| `NEEDS_REVIEW`    | Plausible connection but indirect — needs human judgment. Not a default. |
| `FALSE_POSITIVE`  | Failure unrelated to diff — env/infra/timing/test isolation. |
| `AUTO_CLASSIFIED` | Pre-filtered by `prepare.py` — BUILD_FAILURE, ENV_CHROME, ENV_DATE, ENV_DEPENDENCY, ENV_SETUP, NO_ERROR. |

---

## Caveats

### Baseline must be the last fully passing build (critical for Stable)

The tool surfaces only **PASSED→FAILED** transitions in the A→B window.
Any test that was already failing in Build A is invisible to the classifier —
it appears as FAILED→FAILED and is excluded from `diff_list.csv` entirely.

This creates a gap when a failure persists across multiple builds:

```
Build A  → all pass      (last good build)
Build B  → Test X fails  (regression introduced)
Build C  → Test X fails  (still failing — new commit on top)
```

A **B→C** comparison will not surface Test X. It was already failing in B
(the baseline), so it never appears as a regression. The original A→B
regression has no triage record under the B→C pair.

**For Stable, this is load-bearing.** Stable is all-or-nothing: a failing
build never syncs to repo2, so consecutive failed builds accumulate. If
the baseline is set to any build that was not a fully clean pass, the
triage output silently understates the regression count.

**Mitigation:** Always use the last fully passing Stable build as the
baseline. The Jenkins automation enforces this by only updating
`last_good_build_id` on a clean success. For manual runs, verify the
baseline build ID against Testray before proceeding — a build that shows
any non-pass result is not a valid baseline.

---

## Classifier column — head-to-head comparison

`fact_triage_results` is keyed on `(build_id_b, testray_case_id,
classifier)`. Independent runs can be compared on the same build pair:

```sql
SELECT classifier, classification, COUNT(*)
FROM fact_triage_results
WHERE build_id_b = 462975400
GROUP BY classifier, classification
ORDER BY classifier, classification;
```

Existing labels:

- `batch:v1` — legacy Anthropic-API pipeline (Sonnet 4, markdown-table
  response format), 365 rows on the Routine 82964 historical pair
  (8 BUG / 38 NEEDS_REVIEW / 276 FALSE_POSITIVE / 43 AUTO_CLASSIFIED).
  Retired — the current API path is `api:claude-opus-4-7` below.
- `agent:claude-opus-4-7` — current default for in-session Claude Code
  classification.
- `api:claude-opus-4-7` — current default for API-mode classification
  via `classify_api.py` (Jenkins / headless).
- `human` — reserved for manual overrides.
- `smoke:*` — use for one-off round-trip tests, then delete.

---

## Git diff exclusions

The following are excluded from the diff to reduce noise:

```
artifact.properties, .releng/**, liferay-releng.changelog, app.changelog,
app.properties, bnd.bnd, packageinfo, *.xml, *.properties, *.yml, *.yaml,
*.tf, *.sh, *.scss, *.css, *.gradle, package.json, *.json, cloud/**
```

---

## Backlog

- **`csv × api` join gap** — the two lossy sources can't be joined
  directly (CSV has names but no `case_id`; API has `case_id` but no
  names). Unblock by enriching one side: either follow the case link per
  API caseresult to populate names, or look up CSV rows against the
  Testray API by `(Case Name, Component)` to get `case_id`. Either gives
  us the missing 2 of 9 combos.
- **Jira enrichment for `api` sources** — `linked_issues` is null when a
  side is `api` because the Jira ticket isn't a direct field on the
  caseresult object. Options: (a) follow the subtask link per result and
  resolve jira there; (b) accept the gap since most BUG classifications
  name a culprit file not a Jira ticket.
- **Baseline drift detection** — `compute_test_diff` only surfaces
  PASSED→FAILED transitions. If the baseline build had any test already
  failing, those persist into the target as FAILED→FAILED and are
  invisible to triage. Currently surfaced as a runtime `WARNING:` only
  when fragments are empty; the underlying constraint isn't checked
  generally. Surfaced 2026-04-25 when comparing Pair 4 against a
  human-curated report whose wider window caught a 2nd failure the API
  diff missed. Fix: warn when the baseline build had any non-PASSED
  status before triage runs, and suggest the last known clean build
  pair instead.
- **API-mode tool-using mode (option D)** — current API mode is
  single-shot prompt-only. For cases where a model needs to read source
  files (e.g. verify import statements before asserting BUG), promote
  to a tool-using API loop with `bash`/`grep`/`read` tools scoped to
  liferay-portal. See `apps/triage/CLAUDE.md` "Future options" for the
  trade-off. Not currently needed — Path 2.1 (E + manifest + commits +
  rubric tightening) closes the common transitive-dep gap; revisit only
  if real bugs start escaping that shape.
- **Jira ticket auto-creation** (`create_jira_tickets.py`): Read
  `fact_triage_results` for a build, filter to BUG + NEEDS_REVIEW where
  `linked_issues` is null, create LPD tickets via Jira REST, write
  ticket keys back. Run as a separate manual step.
- **Pipeline logging**: Improve `load_testray` step logging in
  `run_pipeline.sh` so it emits progress milestones.
- **Looker Studio Build Triage page**: Surface `fact_triage_results` as
  a new page in the Situation Deck.
- **`fact_triage_results` → composite score**: BUG count per component
  per build as a 6th signal in `fact_forecast_input`.
- **`fact_triage_results` → `pr_outcomes`**: Each confirmed BUG row
  has `testray_case_id` + `git_hash_b` + `culprit_file` = labeled outcome
  for future NN training.
