apps/triage/classify_api.py

Second classification path for triage run bundles: sends a prepared bundle
(runs/r_<id>/) through the Anthropic SDK and writes the same results.json
a Claude Code session would produce. Used in Jenkins / headless contexts
where a developer can't sit in a Claude Code session.

Usage:
    python3 -m apps.triage.classify_api <run_dir>
    python3 -m apps.triage.classify_api <run_dir> --classifier api:claude-opus-4-7
    python3 -m apps.triage.classify_api <run_dir> --dry-run

    <run_dir> must already exist — produce it with apps.triage.prepare.
    After this script writes results.json, submit with:
        python3 -m apps.triage.submit <run_dir>

Why a second path instead of folding this back into prepare.py:
    prepare.py is classifier-agnostic. Keeping the Anthropic SDK out of
    prepare lets local dev laptops skip the extra dependency install
    unless they explicitly opt into API mode.

API design choices:

    * Structured outputs via output_config.format + json_schema. The
      Anthropic API guarantees the response is a single JSON object
      matching results.schema.json — no prompt-based "please return
      JSON" fence-stripping needed. The schema's conditional
      (BUG → culprit_file required) is stripped before sending (the
      structured-outputs subset does not support `if/then`), and
      enforced post-hoc via jsonschema.validate() against the original
      schema.

    * Streaming via client.messages.stream() + get_final_message().
      max_output_tokens=16000 is generous enough that non-streaming
      risks HTTP idle-timeout on slow responses; streaming keeps the
      connection live and collects the full message transparently.

    * output_config.effort = xhigh. Opus 4.7's effort parameter
      matters more than on any prior Opus. xhigh is Claude Code's
      default and the best setting for agentic / classification work.

    * Retries are delegated to the SDK. anthropic.Anthropic(max_retries=3)
      auto-retries 429 / 408 / 409 / 5xx with exponential backoff — we
      don't wrap another retry loop around it. The only locally-handled
      failure is JSONDecodeError (which shouldn't happen with structured
      outputs but we retry once as belt-and-braces).

Batching / cost rationale:

    Each API call pays for input_tokens + output_tokens. The bundle's
    prompt.md splits naturally into a shared header (context + rubric,
    ~1-5k tokens) and a list of per-failure sections with diff hunks.
    Two cost-shaping levers:

    1. Batch size. Bigger batches amortize the shared header over more
       failures. Default max_chars_per_batch = 400_000 (~100k input
       tokens) is sized so typical bundles of 50-150 failures land in
       1-2 batches instead of the 5-10 the old Sonnet-era pipeline used.

    2. Prompt caching. The shared header is sent with cache_control on
       every call, so only the first batch pays full price for the
       header — subsequent batches read it at ~10% cost within the
       5-minute ephemeral cache window. Cache-hit verification: check
       resp.usage.cache_read_input_tokens on batch 2+ of any multi-batch
       run. If it stays at 0, the header is below Opus 4.7's 4096-token
       minimum cacheable prefix (prefix under the threshold silently
       does not cache — no error).
